**Supplementary Material: Digital Divides in Georgian Youth ICT Use**
This repository hosts supplementary graphs, tables, and detailed statistical output not included in the main manuscript, "Investigating Digital Divides Among Young Georgians: Evidence from the Time Use Survey," published in the Caucasus Analytical Digest (CAD). Due to CAD's strict limitations on visual elements (e.g., a limit of two graphs), this collection provides the necessary quantitative detail to support the paper's core findings.
The study employs a strictly quantitative approach, utilizing descriptive analysis, logistic regression, and multinomial regression models on data from the 2020â€“2021 Georgian Time Use Survey (GTUS). Our focus is on patterns of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use among young Georgians under 30, analyzing persistent disparities across gender and geography.
The analysis confirms that while ICT use is widespread, significant digital divides remain. We find that males allocate more time to entertainment and social ICT activities, while females show greater engagement in education-related digital tasks. Geographically, youth in Tbilisi and other urban areas exhibit markedly higher ICT engagement compared to their rural counterparts. Crucially, the research identifies that approximately 14% of young people in Georgia are digitally excluded, a group disproportionately consisting of rural residents and individuals from lower-income households. Educational enrollment emerged as a significant protective factor against this exclusion.
This repository serves as the detailed evidence base, challenging the assumption of universally digitally native youth and underscoring the necessity of targeted interventions to foster digital literacy and bridge these persistent inequalities.
